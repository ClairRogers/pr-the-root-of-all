                <p>Eight weeks. That’s how long you’ve been here, sitting and waiting. Four weeks ago the wisps had appeared to help you refine your skills, or just be a listening ear to those who needed it. You weren’t sure if you could trust them initially--but they didn’t seem to be here to cause any harm, so warily you allowed them to stay.</p>
                <p>Then one evening the sun sinks like it had for the past eight weeks. Slow and colorful as it descends behind the mountains on the other side of the endless lake, there is something alluring about tonight’s sunset. You feel yourself drawn to come watch from the terrace, to be in the company of your trialmates as the stars emerge. Everyone else seems to have the same feeling as well. You have a sinking suspicion that you know this means your time in the Gardens is coming to an end.</p>
                <p>As the sun lowers, you watch with bated breath for something to happen. And just as the last light of the sun falls behind the horizon, a beam of green light shoots into the sky. The flash is brilliant and blinding for a moment, and when you are finally able to open your eyes again, a great black winged cat is lowering himself out of the air and onto the smooth marble.</p>
                <p>Oordeel has returned.</p>
                <p><b>“I hope you have all prepared,”</b> Oordeel begins as his wings fold shut, <b>“for the war you are about to witness.”</b></p>
                <p>With a sweep of his smoky tail, he walks down the line of your group with a powerful gait, yet carries himself with a grace you can only describe as godly. His sharp yellow eyes study you intently, as if they might pierce through you and discover all your secrets. Finally, he grunts.</p>
                <p><b>“Perhaps our first victory is that none of you have killed each other,”</b> he muses. Evidently, the myriad of scars and scratches haven’t escaped his sight. <b>“It seems you’re all still here. So I’ll need you to tell me how you can make yourselves the most useful.”</b></p>
                <p>He stretches his wings and flaps to a higher pedestal to look at everybody at once.</p>
                <p><b>“I’m taking you all to Highpeak,”</b> Oordeel announces. At this proclamation, a wave of hushed murmuring ripples through the crowd. Oordeel presses on. <b>“I have spent the last few weeks trying to get as close as I could without being noticed. Kaulu and Helena are hiding at the top of the mountain, and they are destroying our world. Helena's open strings are leeching the life straight out of the Valley; the entire place is a deadzone. It's creating her new world. I need to get to the top of Highpeak and stop her, but her magic is keeping me from transporting us all directly there.”</b></p>
                <p><b>“I need each of you to tell me what role you can play,”</b> he continues. <b>“The mountain is crawling with monsters and Plagued cats. If you can fight well and serve as an effective distraction, speak up.”</b></p>
                <p>He pauses to wait for the response. <b>“If you’re interested in rescuing the cats that have been trapped inside the mountain, speak up. Some of you may know them...most of them are simple mortals, but I believe you call some of them the Legendaries. Kaulu has separated them from their soul partners and weakened their power… we need rescue teams to reunite them.”</b></p>
                <p>Oordeel waits again for volunteers, uninterested in the emotional reaction his words stir in some of the trial cats.</p>
                <p><b>“And if you have a talent for stealth, I need you to climb to the top of Highpeak. You need to make sure I can get to Helena unseen, or else this is all for nothing. Speak up.”</b> He pauses again as volunteers raise their voices.</p>
                <p><b>“Are we all clear? Good.</b></p>
                <p><b>“It’s time to end this.”</b></p>
              </div>
              <div class="tab-pane fade" id="story2" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="story-2">
                <p>Anticipation is thick in the air after Oordeel’s announcement. Some of it nervous, some of it excited and determined… all of it filled with purpose. Gradually, as the crowd mingles, decides their positions, and exchanges their “good luck”s and “be careful”s, three large groups slowly form: the cats who want to battle, those who want to climb the mountain, and those who want to help those trapped within it.</p> 
                <p><b>“Very good,”</b> Oordeel says, his voice practically a purr. His orange gaze is hard, but satisfied. <b>“My sister and that <i>dog</i> think they have your world in their grasp. But they are wrong.”</b> He spreads his wings wide, sweeping his gaze over everyone gathered below. <b>“This is their reckoning. <i>This</i> is a legion to contend with.”</b></p>
                <p>He turns away from you for a moment, his eyes lifting towards the sky and the stars that are slowly starting to appear in the inky abyss. An emotion you can’t quite place swims in his gaze and you can’t help but wonder… after all he’s seen, where do his thoughts take him now?</p>
                <p>He turns back to you, squaring his shoulders. The fading light catches in his eyes and the gold of his collar. A rare, grim smile crosses his face. </p>
                <p><b>“To war,”</b> he declares.</p>
                <p>And then black smoke sweeps through your ranks, cloaking you in darkness, and you leave everything you know behind. </p>
                <br>
                <hr>
                <br>
                <p><i>Meanwhile, in the Valley...</i></p>
                <p>The attack came with little warning. The cries of alarm started from the Red Plague quarantine quarters, but spread rapidly throughout the tunnels.The scarlet eyes of those you had been seeking to heal gleamed in the dark tunnels back at you, malicious and violent. Something had changed. The Plagued cats turned their claws on you.</p>
                <p>You wanted to fight back. At first, you did. But these were the faces of your loved ones. This was the blood of your friends. You could not bring yourself to kill them, and the Legendaries commanded you not to. You were overpowered, exhausted, nearly starved--and the force of the Plague cats was overwhelming. But the sick did not kill you, not unless you fought back. They rounded you up and led you into the deep.</p>
                <p>You are no longer refugees. You are all prisoners.</p>

                  <h3>Character Roles</h3>
                  <p>Each role will focus mainly on a certain aspect of gameplay--combat, puzzles, or story. This doesn’t mean that it will be the only element you experience, however; combat-focused players should also get a little bit of puzzles and story, puzzle-focused players will still get story elements and battle, and story-focused players will still get battles and puzzles. </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><b>Battle</b> teams will be the main teams fighting monsters and plagued cats. Players will be using DnD-type battle mechanics, rolling for attacks and damage, and maybe having some small challenge mechanics as well.</li>
                    <li><b>Stealth</b> teams are mainly focused on sneaking to the top of Highpeak, and finding ways around Helena’s defenses. This role is focused on puzzles, riddles, and problem-solving.</li>
                    <li><b>Support</b> teams will mainly be search-and-rescue parties for the NPCs and Legendaries trapped in the Valley. This role is focused more heavily on writing and story.</li>

                    <li>Battle teams will be engaging with Helena's forces, clearing a path and keeping them away from other teams.</li>
                    <li>Stealth teams will be sneaking up the back side of Highpeak, attempting to find a way to get to Helena.</li>

              <li>In your posting format, please make sure to include: post number, link to character app, link to skill sheet, post summary, and current HP (out of 20).</li>
              <li>Only roleplay in your assigned Google Doc with your assigned teammates.</li>
              <li>Checkpoints will be given no less frequently than every other day, but sometimes will come more often than that.</li>
              <li>Try to check your current doc at least once a day if you can to stay updated, but you don’t have to post every time!</li>
              <li>Try your best to communicate with your quest teammates if you are going to be inactive for a long period of time! Alert the mods as well.</li>
              <li>Like last time, this Trial has a specific timeline and we are trying to keep it fairly fast-paced and therefore checkpoints will not wait for players who are inactive. Please be accommodating to a teammate who has missed and needs help catching up if they need it! The mods will do their best as well.</li>
