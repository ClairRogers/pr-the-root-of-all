                <p>The heartbeat of purgatory never ceases. Like a living thing, that odd thrumming feeling under the ground that calls you towards the tree keeps pulsing, soft and strong under your paws. You begin to ignore it; nothing has come of it, after all. It is just always there in the background, a mysterious metronome to your daily life.</p> 
                <p>But something is different today. This time, the heartbeat changes. This time... it <i>grows.</i> It swells like a song, stronger than ever before, and soon, between the cracks of the ever-dry dirt, you see pulses of light. Like veins, the dots of light zip past your feet, all moving towards the tree. The light is all colors; red and blue and green and purple and black. There seems to be no rhyme or reason to the patterns; just a jumble of colors, together but distinct.</p>
                <p>This pulsing light has an effect on you. It makes your heart soar with a sort of rejuvenation you haven't felt in ages. You feel young again, and with a spring in your step, you follow the pulses of color–all the way to the tree. There, you gather and watch as the light travels out of the ground around the base of the tree and zips up the bark, weaving and twisting and then spreading out again across the branches before disappearing. Brief crowns of colorful foliage flash and then fade, over and over.</p> 
                <p>The pulses grow, getting brighter and faster until it seems like the entire tree is illuminated with color. Just when you think it can't get more intense, the light <i>explodes</i> in a flash, blinding you for just a moment. But when you open your eyes again, the tree is no longer glowing. Instead, you see flecks of beautiful colors floating in the air around you like embers. You feel a breeze on your pelt. And up above, the dreary dark clouds that have hung overhead since your arrival begin to produce the most pleasant, soft rainfall you have ever felt in your life.</p>
                <p>And standing at the base of the tree is a lanky brown tom.</p>
                <p><b> "Oh!"</b> Chirek says, blinking hard a couple times. His pupils flash with teal light before returning to normal. He is smiling. <b> "You're here! It worked!"</b></p> 
                <p>Immediately, everyone erupts into exclamations and chatter. Many of you rush forwards to greet him or whisper excitedly amongst yourselves. Some exchange worried glances, concerned about what this might mean. Chirek himself seems relieved, and regardless of what you may feel, there is some comfort in reuniting with a familiar face for a while. Eventually though, he steps back and waves his tail. <b>“Everyone--please! I know this is a lot, but--I’m here for a reason. There is something I have to try.” </b></p> 
                <p>You watch him drag a sort of irregular circle in the dirt with a claw, and then step inside of it. His eyes close tight and his jaw sets with concentration for a moment--and then he lifts one paw up into the air over his head, claws outstretched. Each claw, though, is shining with a different color. Red, blue, green, purple, and black. Each soul class. The clouds over the tree suddenly begin to part, and finally you are able to see what they had been hiding: a view into the vast expanse of the universe. Over your head, billions and billions of stars blink and glow from an inky purple backdrop, so bright it feels like you are almost standing among them. Bands of faraway suns paint the backdrop with hazy galaxies; and stars sparkle like frost on a moonlit night. The beauty and the vastness and the <i>closeness</i> of it leaves you speechless.</p> 
                <p>Chirek's claws glow brighter, reaching up even higher... and as he does, you make out the sudden bright outline of constellations. Five of them, each glowing the same colors as Chirek's five claws.</p>
                <p>You feel so open. Your chest sings, and it feels like anyone could see right into your heart itself at this very moment if they tried. For a second, you look around at your trialmates, these cats you have come to know as friends or family or enemies or even still strangers. You feel, for a moment, more drawn to them than you ever have before.</p>
                <p>And then they are gone. You are standing by yourself among the stars, alone and in awe of the beauty around you.</p>
                <p>Well... not completely alone. Chirek stands before you, his chest puffed out, a look of determination on his face.</p>
                <p><b> "It's time. Are you ready to save everyone? For good, this time?"</b> He gives you a smile, and despite all the hardships and death and monsters and fear you have felt since you first walked into the Valley, you believe him. It is time to save them--every last one. You nod.</p>
                <p><b> "Good. Me, too. But first, you must do one more thing for yourself: answer my question. You know the answer, now. You have to."</b> He leans forward, his gaze intense.</p>
                <p><b> "Who is your soul partner?"</b></p>

                  <h3>Soulrooting</h3>
                  <p>Welcome to Trial 5: The Root of All. As our final trial begins, you have all been asked a question: Who is your soul partner? Now is the time for soulrooting! </p>
                  <p>For the next two days we will have the soul partner guess form open for submissions. During this time, please keep your soul partner guesses to yourselves! Just a little longer before soul partner information will be public. </p>
                  <p>At the end of the guessing period we will be sending out responses to your guesses. Even when you receive your response, <b>keep this secret,</b> because we will be revealing all of the soul partners AT ONCE during a live event!</p> 
                  <p>The SOUL PARTNER REVEAL EVENT will take place on <b>Monday, August 22nd</b> in the voice chat on the Discord server. We will be voting as a group to decide what time works best for the whole, but if you are unable to attend, don't worry--we'll be recording the event and posting it to a private YouTube video for you to enjoy later.</p>
