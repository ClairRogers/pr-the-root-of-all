                <p>The heartbeat of purgatory never ceases. Like a living thing, that odd thrumming feeling under the ground that calls you towards the tree keeps pulsing, soft and strong under your paws. You begin to ignore it; nothing has come of it, after all. It is just always there in the background, a mysterious metronome to your daily life.</p> 
                <p>But something is different today. This time, the heartbeat changes. This time... it <i>grows.</i> It swells like a song, stronger than ever before, and soon, between the cracks of the ever-dry dirt, you see pulses of light. Like veins, the dots of light zip past your feet, all moving towards the tree. The light is all colors; red and blue and green and purple and black. There seems to be no rhyme or reason to the patterns; just a jumble of colors, together but distinct.</p>
                <p>This pulsing light has an effect on you. It makes your heart soar with a sort of rejuvenation you haven't felt in ages. You feel young again, and with a spring in your step, you follow the pulses of color--ll the way to the tree. There, you gather and watch as the light travels out of the ground around the base of the tree and zips up the bark, weaving and twisting and then spreading out again across the branches before disappearing. Brief crowns of colorful foliage flash and then fade, over and over.</p> 
                <p>The pulses grow, getting brighter and faster until it seems like the entire tree is illuminated with color. Just when you think it can't get more intense, the light <i>explodes</i> in a flash, blinding you for just a moment. But when you open your eyes again, the tree is no longer glowing. Instead, you see flecks of beautiful colors floating in the air around you like embers. You feel a breeze on your pelt. And up above, the dreary dark clouds that have hung overhead since your arrival begin to produce the most pleasant, soft rainfall you have ever felt in your life.</p>
                <p>And standing at the base of the tree is a lanky brown tom.</p>
                <p><b> "Oh!"</b> Chirek says, blinking hard a couple times. His pupils flash with teal light before returning to normal. He is smiling. <b> "You're here! It worked!"</b></p> 
                <p>Immediately, everyone erupts into exclamations and chatter. Many of you rush forwards to greet him or whisper excitedly amongst yourselves. Some exchange worried glances, concerned about what this might mean. Chirek himself seems relieved, and regardless of what you may feel, there is some comfort in reuniting with a familiar face for a while. Eventually though, he steps back and waves his tail. <b>â€œEveryone--please! I know this is a lot, but--I'm here for a reason. There is something I have to try." </b></p> 
                <p>You watch him drag a sort of irregular circle in the dirt with a claw, and then step inside of it. His eyes close tight and his jaw sets with concentration for a moment--and then he lifts one paw up into the air over his head, claws outstretched. Each claw, though, is shining with a different color. Red, blue, green, purple, and black. Each soul class. The clouds over the tree suddenly begin to part, and finally you are able to see what they had been hiding: a view into the vast expanse of the universe. Over your head, billions and billions of stars blink and glow from an inky purple backdrop, so bright it feels like you are almost standing among them. Bands of faraway suns paint the backdrop with hazy galaxies; and stars sparkle like frost on a moonlit night. The beauty and the vastness and the <i>closeness</i> of it leaves you speechless.</p> 
                <p>Chirek's claws glow brighter, reaching up even higher... and as he does, you make out the sudden bright outline of constellations. Five of them, each glowing the same colors as Chirek's five claws.</p>
                <p>You feel so open. Your chest sings, and it feels like anyone could see right into your heart itself at this very moment if they tried. For a second, you look around at your trialmates, these cats you have come to know as friends or family or enemies or even still strangers. You feel, for a moment, more drawn to them than you ever have before.</p>
                <p>And then they are gone. You are standing by yourself among the stars, alone and in awe of the beauty around you.</p>
                <p>Well... not completely alone. Chirek stands before you, his chest puffed out, a look of determination on his face.</p>
                <p><b> "It's time. Are you ready to save everyone? For good, this time?"</b> He gives you a smile, and despite all the hardships and death and monsters and fear you have felt since you first walked into the Valley, you believe him. It is time to save them--every last one. You nod.</p>
                <p><b> "Good. Me, too. But first, you must do one more thing for yourself: answer my question. You know the answer, now. You have to."</b> He leans forward, his gaze intense.</p>
                <p><b> "Who is your soul partner?"</b></p>
              </div>
              <div class="tab-pane fade show active" id="story2" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="story-2">
                <p>After you've had a bit of time to talk and meet the other half of your soul, or mourn the half that was lost, Chirek calls your attention once more. It takes some time because of how engrossed you are with one another, but eventually you turn your heads to look at him.</p>
                <p>And it's odd... from a distance, you notice that the little bit of rain that had fallen when Chirek arrived had left a pool around the base of the tree where Chirek stood. The water was so still, even when Chirek moved, it was like glass. Like a mirror. In the mirror, you can see Chirek's reflection, but in his reflection his eyes are bright, Plague red. The tree in the reflection is lush and healthy, sunlight catching the edges of the leaves in a halo. It looks so peaceful, and for a moment your mind thinks of one word--paradise.</p>
                <p>Chirek doesn't seem to notice when he begins speaking. He begins to blabber thoughtfully, as if he's talking more to himself than anyone else. <b>"Dolores and I suspected that soulrooting would be powerful enough for you all to return to your bodies--that's why Helena couldn't infect the Legendaries, right? A whole soul can't be severed the way a halfsoul can. But it seems like you're still here, so here was our other theory--this place is too... <i>heavy.</i> There are too many souls here holding it together. So what's next?"</b></p> 
                <p>He leans forward then, his tail twitching eagerly. <b>"You can feel it, right? Don't you feel brighter, sharper, more alive? The mists won't take you when your souls are whole, while your powers are awakened."</b> He's right, you realize. The mists didn't pull at your chest the way they did before. You didn't feel that ache, that yearning to give in and let them swallow you. You look out into them and they don't feel as alive as they once had. The mists did not call you to them... but you get the sense they were still a prison.</p>
                <p>You knew thousands, maybe millions of souls wandered those mists. Lost, forgotten, <i>Plagued.</i> Maybe you had once come to Paradise Valley for glory, for power, for revenge. But now, you knew... you'd come to the Valley for <i>them.</i> And you would not leave them here.</p>
                <p><b>"Will you follow me?"</b> Chirek prompts you. <b>"Into the mists?"</b><p>
                <p>You will. And you do.</p> 
                <p>At the edge of the mist, Chirek hesitates, reaching a paw outwards. The mist reaches back and envelops his foot, and he yanks back. But you notice how the mists pull <i>away</i> from your own presence when you approach. Chirek notices, too, and he steps aside, letting you lead the way. As you step forward, the mists part, giving you a path forward.</p>
                <p>You walk as a group for a few minutes, the mists refusing to come in contact with your pelts. Chirek walks safely in the center of the group where the mists can't reach him. Suddenly, he calls out, <b>"Stop! Who's that?"</b></p>
                <p>And he's right--up ahead there is the form of a cat standing still in the mists. You hesitate for a moment. It looks like a ghost. But you know this is just a soul who has lost their way, and you have come to help them.</p>
                <p>The cat ahead does not seem to notice as you get closer. Or maybe they don't care. As the mist parts, you recognize the pelt, the mournful gaze. But Aberdeen does not recognize you. She says nothing, and barely even passes you all a glance when you arrive, even though you're sure seeing a hoard of cats traveling like this would be an unusual sight in these mists. She just continues about her eternal wandering, gazing off into nothing.</p>
                <p>Chirek seems troubled seeing her. He approaches and, after a pause, pushes his nose against the side of her head. She glances at him before turning back. Chirek looks at you. <b>"She's so lost..."</b> he says sadly, his gaze falling. <b>"I knew the Plague was bad, but..."</b></p>
                <p>You are silent, mourning Aberdeen, mourning all the cats you knew who were wandering Purgatory just like this. After a moment, Chirek opens his mouth as if to say something, but his ears perk up and his head snaps out into the mist. You follow his gaze--another group of cats are shrouded in the mists nearby. When someone goes to them, the mist reveals four more, some of which are familiar to you; Bluebell, the Forest Colony leader. Dandelion and Huckleberry, two of the cats you had managed to temporarily protect from Helena's killing game in Trial Two. And the fourth is the large pale form of Morwen, the leader of the River Colony. They give you the same dead, uncaring stares and glances that Aberdeen had. Some of you gently usher them closer to stand with Aberdeen, and they follow wordlessly.</p>
                <p>Five lost souls stand before you.</p>
                <p>Chirek's eyes harden with sudden determination, and he turns away from the Plagued to address you once again. <b>"We are going to help them. We are going to <i>save</i> them. They're lost, they don't remember who they are. We are going to wake them up. It's time to awaken their souls."</b></p>
                <p>Chirek closes his eyes and immediately his whole front leg ignites with teal magic. He makes a large sweeping gesture, and in a large area where the mist once was, a bunch of structures form out of nowhere. Chirek is tense with concentration as you take in the scene.</p>
                <p>In the center there is a pile of dry wood, arranged in a complex pile, not unlike a pyre. Just beside it is a large flat gray stone, balanced on a pointed rock in the center underneath, and a sheet of ice over the surface. Below the ice you can see a complex maze with a stone ball at the edge. Scattered around the clearing are tall, dark stone structures with deep, black shadows. You can't tell if they are caves or if the shadows are darker than usual. Across the top of all of the structures are interwoven green vines that almost look like a spiderweb. Every so often there is a windchime hanging from the web. And weaving around everything in a long closed loop is a brook with stepping stones interrupting the flow of water.</p>
                <p>Chirek steps back, winded from the effort. The five Plagued cats seem unimpressed, but you feel a sense of awe at the sight. You'd only ever seen a god with the power to manifest things like this before.</p>
                <p>Chirek smirks. <b>"What do we say? Reminding the lost cats who they are, showing them their soul, it just might create enough energy to break this place open and get back home. Let's help them discover their powers, just like you guys did. Now... what should we have them do?"</b></p>

                  <h3>Soulrooting</h3>
                  <p>Welcome to Trial 5: The Root of All. As our final trial begins, you have all been asked a question: Who is your soul partner? Now is the time for soulrooting! </p>
                  <p>For the next two days we will have the soul partner guess form open for submissions. During this time, please keep your soul partner guesses to yourselves! Just a little longer before soul partner information will be public. </p>
                  <p>At the end of the guessing period we will be sending out responses to your guesses. Even when you receive your response, <b>keep this secret,</b> because we will be revealing all of the soul partners AT ONCE during a live event!</p> 
                  <p>The SOUL PARTNER REVEAL EVENT will take place on <b>Monday, August 22nd</b> in the voice chat on the Discord server. We will be voting as a group to decide what time works best for the whole, but if you are unable to attend, don't worry--we'll be recording the event and posting it to a private YouTube video for you to enjoy later.</p>

                  <p>For the first two days of this event, we will be opening up <b>team signups.</b> That's right--for this part you will be choosing your own teams!</p>
                  <p>Once we are on our teams, we will be dispersing into the mists to find NPCs and awaken their souls. Just like Trial 02, we will be limiting each player to one NPC slot. Your NPC must have the Plague and be stuck in the mists. You are not required to claim an NPC slot--we will give teams extra NPCs if we feel it is needed!</p>
                  <p>You may decide your own NPC's soul class! However, if you aren't sure what class to pick, we have a few options:</p><ul> <li>You can ask the mods to select a class for you. We can either keep this secret from you or tell you right away. We can also give you a couple options to choose from! We're here to help!</li><li>Use a soul class quiz! <a href="https://uquiz.com/dQJvQ9">Here is the one made by Stan,</a> but you can use any that have been created to help you.</li></ul>
                  <p>You might want to keep your NPC's class secret from your teammates, and even the mods! The reveal will be more fun that way, and give your teammates and your mod a little something more to puzzle out! But this is not required.</p>
